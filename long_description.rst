NeuroImaging Workflows (NIWorkflows) is a selection of image processing workflows
for magnetic resonance images of the brain. It is designed to provide an easily
accessible, state-of-the-art interface that is robust to differences in scan
acquisition protocols and that requires minimal user input.

This open-source neuroimaging data processing tool is being developed as a part of
the MRI image analysis and reproducibility platform offered by the CRN.
